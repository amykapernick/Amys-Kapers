		<h1>Modern Front End Fundamentals</h1>
		<p>
			What does a modern front end actually look like? It's one that built
			using semantic HTML, the layouts are built with modern CSS and no
			frameworks, is accessible to all users no matter their abilities or
			how they consume the site and all this is backed up with a
			completely automated testing pipeline to ensure code changes only
			affect what we intended.
		</p>
		<p>
			Unless you're working in the front end on a daily basis, it's hard
			to keep up to date and ensure that your front end is still modern.
			This hands on workshop covers modern front end fundamentals,
			enabling you to create a layout and components without the need for
			any third party code. You learn core accessibility concepts to make
			your project more accessible without having to write complex code,
			take shortcuts or deal with browser specific implementations.
		</p>
		<p>
			Once that is done, we then move on to testing our application,
			making sure that our accessibility improvements are there, watching
			for any unintended changes and making sure that the application
			works as it's supposed to. Through automated tools that can be
			implemented as part of a deployment pipeline, to manual tools to
			check on the fly, there are plenty of options to ensure the front
			end is being tested as thoroughly as the back end.
		</p>
		<p>
			After the tests are written, we'll then integrate them as part of an
			approval and deployment pipeline. Automating the tests for pull
			requests, running through GitHub actions and ensuring that code is
			fully tested before it reaches the production branch of your repo.
		</p>

		<Testimonial>
			<p>
				I attended Amy's CSS workshop, after having seen her speak at
				NDC London. After only a few hours I already had a much better
				understanding of modern CSS principles (it isn't all !important
				tags apparently) and I can now put together a robust CSS
				framework for my web development. Thanks Amy.

		<Testimonial>
			<p>
				You don't know what you don't know this workshop really opened
				my eyes to the amount of accessibility we dismiss on the daily.
				Leant some useful tools and techniques to keep future work
				accessible for all.
			</p>
		</Testimonial>
		<Testimonial>
			<p>
				Really great workshop. As someone who isn't the biggest fan of
				frontend development, this workshop really made me appreciate
				how easy it could be to design not only responsive layouts
				without a css framework, but also make them accessible as well
				which is something I always overlook.
