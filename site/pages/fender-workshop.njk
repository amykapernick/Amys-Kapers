	<h1>Front End Web Fundamentals</h1>
	<p>Where is the border between frontend and backend web development? Yeah, exactly. It is becoming increasingly common for developers to work in both areas, yet only have the skillset for one. This often results in relying on third party frameworks or components like Bootstrap to pull a layout together, further weighing down the application with unnecessary code libraries and resulting technical debt.</p>
	<p>This hands on workshop covers modern front end fundamentals, enabling you to create a layout and components without the need for any third party code. You learn core accessibility concepts to make your project more accessible without having to write complex code, take shortcuts or deal with browser specific implementations.</p>
	<p>Once that is done, we then move on to testing our application, making sure that our accessibility improvements are there, watching for any unintended changes and making sure that the application works as it's supposed to. Through automated tools that can be implemented as part of a deployment pipeline, to manual tools to check on the fly, there are plenty of options to ensure the front end is being tested as thoroughly as the back end.</p>
	<h2>Topics</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>CSS Layouts</li>
		<li>Semantic HTML</li>
		<li>Modern CSS</li>
		<li>Accessibility Testing</li>
		<li>Visual Regression Testing</li>
		<li>UI Testing</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Still not convinced?</h2>
	<p>If you're still not sure, check out these testimonials from previous workshop participants:</p>
	<blockquote class="testimonial">
		<p>I attended Amy's CSS workshop, after having seen her speak at NDC London. After only a few hours I already had a much better understanding of modern CSS principles (it isn't all !important tags apparently) and I can now put together a robust CSS framework for my web development. Thanks Amy.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote class="testimonial">
		<p>You don't know what you don't know this workshop really opened my eyes to the amount of accessibility we dismiss on the daily. Leant some useful tools and techniques to keep future work accessible for all.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote class="testimonial">
		<p>Really great workshop. As someone who isn't the biggest fan of frontend development, this workshop really made me appreciate how easy it could be to design not only responsive layouts without a css framework, but also make them accessible as well which is something I always overlook.</p>
