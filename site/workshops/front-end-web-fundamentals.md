title: Front End Web Fundamentals
length: 2 days
---

Where is the border between frontend and backend web development? Yeah, exactly. It is becoming increasingly common for developers to work in both areas, yet only have the skillset for one. This often results in relying on third party frameworks or components like Bootstrap to pull a layout together, further weighing down the application with unnecessary code libraries and resulting technical debt.

This hands-on workshop covers modern front end fundamentals, enabling you to create a layout and components without the need for any third party code. You learn core accessibility concepts to make your project more accessible without having to write complex code, take shortcuts or deal with browser specific implementations.

Once that is done, we then move on to testing our application, making sure that our accessibility improvements are there, watching for any unintended changes and making sure that the application works as it's supposed to. Through automated tools that can be implemented as part of a deployment pipeline, to manual tools to check on the fly, there are plenty of options to ensure the front end is being tested as thoroughly as the back end.
